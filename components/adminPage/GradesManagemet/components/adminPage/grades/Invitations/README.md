Here’s a human-readable explanation of your Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) — written as if you’re walking a school admin, developer, or stakeholder through how your school platform works:

🧠 School Platform: How Everything Connects
👤 Users
Every person on the platform is a User — this includes school admins, learners, and teachers.

Each user has:

A unique email and auth0_id (for authentication).

A digital wallet (cash_account), payment history, and a list of schools they belong to.

🏫 Schools and User Roles
A School is created by a user and has important details like name, email, address, location, and branding.

The relationship between a User and a School is managed through UserSchoolRole, which defines:

What role the user has (e.g. Admin, Teacher, Learner).

When they were assigned and whether their access has expired.

📚 Grades and Learners
Each School contains multiple Grades (like Grade 1, Grade 8, etc.), each with:

Curriculum info, schedule, capacity, fees, and age limits.

A Learner is assigned to a specific Grade and School.

Learners have their own emergency contact info, phone numbers, birthdates, and parent details.

✉️ Invitations for Learners and Teachers
Sarah, the school admin, can invite learners and teachers to join the platform.

👨‍🎓 Learner Invitations
Sent through the LearnerInvitation model.

Includes:

Contact info (email, phone),

A secure invitation_token,

Status (pending, accepted, expired), and

Tracks when it was sent and accepted.

Once accepted, the learner is officially linked via the Learner model.

👩‍🏫 Teacher Invitations
Similar to learners, but stored in TeacherInvitation.

Also includes:

The grades the teacher will teach,

A token,

Their contact info,

And the school they’re joining.

✅ After Invitation: Formal Assignment
Once a teacher accepts their invite, they’re officially added to a Grade using the TeacherGradeAssignment model.

This keeps track of who assigned them, their role type (e.g. "Math Teacher"), and when.

💬 Communication
Sarah can send messages to learners and teachers using a variety of channels:

CommunicationChannel logs each method used:

Type: WhatsApp, SMS, Email

Provider: Twilio, WinSMS, BulkSMS

Destination (e.g., phone number)

Metadata like status, message ID, etc.

🎯 End Result
Learners and teachers get invited, join the platform, and are linked to their grades and school.

Admins can track everything: who joined, which roles they have, and communicate with them using integrated messaging services.
